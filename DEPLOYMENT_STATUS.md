## ⚠️ Netlify Deployment Issue

**Problem:** Netlify is connected to Git but missing backend functionality.

**Issue:** Netlify is designed for static sites, but Trade Book requires:
- Node.js server
- PostgreSQL database
- Authentication system
- Backend APIs

### 🔧 Solution Options:

#### Option 1: Disable Netlify (Recommended)
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Delete or stop auto-publishing the Trade Book site
3. Use Railway as the primary deployment

#### Option 2: Configure Netlify + Railway Backend
- Use Netlify for frontend static files
- Configure API calls to point to Railway backend
- More complex setup, not recommended

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Use Railway only** - it's designed for full-stack applications like Trade Book.

Railway provides:
- ✅ Node.js hosting
- ✅ PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ Auto-deployment from Git
- ✅ HTTPS & custom domains
- ✅ Logs & monitoring

## 🔄 Current Status Summary

| Service | Status | Features | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Railway** | ✅ Working | All features functional | **Primary** |
| **Netlify** | ❌ Incomplete | Static only, no backend | Disable |

**Next Steps:**
1. Disable/delete Netlify deployment
2. Use Railway URL as primary app URL
3. Update any bookmarks/links to Railway URL
4. Consider custom domain on Railway if needed
